GIT Tutorials



Initialize git repo

#git init



This will create a empty  git repo called in current directory /.git/



Check git status

# git status



Git will show untrack files and directories.



We can add files / dir to repo in staging area 

#git add file_name.txt



Check status 

#git status



Now commit changes with comment

#git commit -m "Added file_name.txt to repository"



We can use some wild characters like *

#git add '*.txt'    (to add all .txt files to git from current dir)



Check what has been changed 

#git log



Push our local repo to github/gitx 

#git remote add origin https://github.com/xyz



First pull and then push 

git reset --mixed origin/master

origin is our remote git and master is our default local branch

now push our local repo(master branch) to origin

#git push -u origin master  (-u is to tell git to remember the remote git name so next time we can simply say git push)



Pull master branch from origin 

#git pull origin master



Look for changes made by others.

#git diff HEAD  (HEAD is the pointer to our latest commit)



You may want to change differences in staging area too with 

#git diff --staged



We can unstage changes by using reset 

#git reset file_name.txt



Remove something from repo (check out something) : git checkout -- (target) (undo)

#git checkout -- file_name.txt



Define our own branch to work temp 

#git branch clean_up



Switch to branches master and clean_up with checkout 

#git checkout clean_up



Remove files/dir from clean_up branch

#git rm '*.txt'

or 

#git rm -r directory



Commit changes

#git commit - m "removed all 8.txt files "



Merge two branches (clean_up with master)

#git merge clean_up



How to delete a branch ?

#git branch -d clean_up
